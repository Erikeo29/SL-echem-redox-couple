## 1. Cyclic voltammetry principle

Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is arguably the most widely used electrochemical method for acquiring qualitative information about electrochemical reactions.

It involves scanning the potential of a working electrode at a constant rate $v$ between two limits, while measuring the resulting current. The graph of current versus potential is called a **voltammogram**.

## 2. Impedance spectroscopy principle

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is complementary to CV: it operates in the **frequency domain**. A small sinusoidal perturbation ($\Delta E = 10$ mV) is applied, and the current response (amplitude + phase shift) allows construction of the complex impedance $Z(\omega)$.

**Nyquist** and **Bode** diagrams reveal resistances (solution, charge transfer, passive film) and capacitances (double layer) that are inaccessible through CV.

## 3. Modeling challenges

Numerical simulation allows us to:
1. Predict the shape of current peaks as a function of scan rate (CV)
2. Extract kinetic constants ($k^0$) and diffusion coefficients ($D$)
3. Understand depletion phenomena near the electrode
4. Separate resistive and capacitive contributions of the interface (EIS)
5. Diagnose the presence and properties of passive films
6. Quantify the influence of redox couple properties on impedance response

In this project, two complementary studies cover:
- **Study 1**: the **ferro/ferricyanide**-type redox couple ($Fe(CN)_6^{3-/4-}$) on a pure gold electrode, using CV
- **Study 2**: the same redox couple on a pure gold electrode, using EIS
